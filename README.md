# Number Guessing Game

## About Number Guessing Game

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created for one of my labs in my class and
follows exactly what my professor asked to be designed. I am
limited on the methods and techniques I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook.

The instructions were to create a number guessing game. The user gets
five tries. After each guess the program will prompt the user if they
are close or far away from the guess.

2. Run the application.
3. Review the menu.
4. Input number guess.
5. Review the output.

## Usage

The purpose of this program is to play a number guessing game. The
program will give you five tries.

If difference of your guess is >= 50
  The program will output: very high/low
If difference is >= 30 and <= 50
  The program will output: high/low
If difference is >= 15 and <= 30
  The program will output: moderately high/low
If difference is > 0 and < 15
  The program will output: somewhat high/low
