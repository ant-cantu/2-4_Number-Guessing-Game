# Number Guessing Game

## About Number Guessing Game

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created for one of my labs in my class and
follows exactly what my professor asked to be designed. I am
limited on the methods and techniques I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook.

The instructions were to create a number guessing game. The user gets
five tries. After each guess the program will prompt the user if they
are close or far away from the guess.

## Usage

The purpose of this program is to play a number guessing game. The
program will give you five tries.

<ul>
<li>If difference of your guess is >= 50 <br>
  <ul>
  <li><b>The program will output: very high/low</b></li> <br>
  </ul>
If difference is >= 30 and <= 50 <br>
  <li><b>The program will output: high/low</b></li> <br>
If difference is >= 15 and <= 30 <nr>
  <li><b>The program will output: moderately high/low</b></li> <br>
If difference is > 0 and < 15 <br>
  <li><b>The program will output: somewhat high/low</b></li> <br>
</ul>
